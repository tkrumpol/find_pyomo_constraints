# Project 06-682

-   [x] Put your project proposal in a document called project-proposal.md. You
    should refine this to clarify your plan and what you want your project to
    accomplish.

Your project should:

-   [x] Put a link to your Deepnote repository where you did the work in the
    readme.md.  
    - Here is the [link](https://deepnote.com/workspace/tom-krumpolc-8bc0-9971debd-9ed4-45ae-9851-9b3c3332d434/project/lecture-01-Duplicate-F0PBQE5jQyCSiw8dn-8JEA/%2Fproject-tkrumpol%2Freadme.md)
-   [x] solve a practical problem that is not too trivial, and that a reusable
    package would be helpful for.
-   [x] be pip installable
    - There is a test checking for this on GitHub Actions
-   [x] have a License
-   [x] have a readme.md file that explains what it is, and how to use it. If you
    have a command line utility, there should be examples of how to use it, and
    the output. If your package is for a notebook you should provide an example
    notebook, including data if it is needed.
    - There is no command line utility.
-   [x] Should pass black, flake8 and pylint (ideally you would setup pre-commit
    hooks to help ensure this)  
    - There are tests to check these on GitHub Actions
-   [x] Should have some tests that are run in a GitHUB action, and your project
    should pass them.  
    Current tests:
    - black
    - pylint
    - flake8
    - pip installable
    - (3) tests related to checking the functionality of the main function 


You should put your project code in a directory called `src`. You can name your
project anything you want inside of that.
